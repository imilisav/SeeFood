    <h1>Tutorial</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to SeeFood! This app is an excellent way of showcasing the
    many great dishes restaurants have to offer. Due to space restrictions, menus only have
    a few plates that are advertised with a picture. This doesn't allow you to fully
    explore your options as much as SeeFood can. SeeFood aims to show you each dish
    in 3D, allowing you to make an informed decision about what you want.</p>
    <p>Using SeeFood is easy:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Scan the QR code (Blue QR code) at a restaurant partnered with us.</li>
        <li>You'll be given a menu, and you can choose any item to see in 3D.</li>
        <li>Direct the camera at the SeeFood Marker (looks like a square with the SeeFood branding on it) and the dish should be visible.</li>
    </ol>
